Simple Snake Game with Advanced Features
This project is a modern take on the classic Snake game, enhanced with exciting features and advanced programming techniques:

Key Features
Shortest Path Visualization:

When the snake eats food, the shortest path from the snake's current location to the food is calculated using the A search algorithm*.
This optimal path is dynamically displayed in green on the game board.
Multi-Threaded Execution:

The path visualization is implemented using multi-threading, ensuring it runs seamlessly alongside the main game without affecting gameplay performance.
Autonomous Mode:

If the snake touches the entry of the green path, it switches to autonomous mode, following the path to the food at high speed for bonus rewards.
Efficient Memory Management:

The game utilizes smart pointers to efficiently manage resources for the snake and path objects.
